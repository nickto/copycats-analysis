        \item Note: Copycat funds are sorted into deciles every January, April, July and October. The returns are then kept for 3 months, and equally weighted every month. Decile 1 holds the lowest 10\% of the values, while Decile 10 holds the highest. They are then linked together in a series for each decile. All numbers are reported in monthly terms and in percentage terms. t-statistics are reported in parentheses.\\
        * Significant at the 10\% level. \\
        ** Significant at the 5\% level. \\
        *** Significant at the 1\% level.
